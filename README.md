# Escape The Dead

This is a Next.js example that demonstrates how you can quickly set up interactive calculators as landing pages, lead capture tools, or interactive content for your audience using [Summit](https://usesummit.com).

## See it in action

This example is hosted as a working app on [escapethedead.com](https://escapethedead.com). It's a Halloween themed single-page app that calculates a startup runway to see if your business will survive until next Halloween, or if the zombie businesses will catch up and eat you.

## Use this example

Run `npx create-next-app@latest --example https://github.com/usesummit/nextjs-example-escape-the-dead` to get started.

The `pages/api/escape.ts` file shows you how to call a Summit calculator and parse its results to bring it into your own app logic.
